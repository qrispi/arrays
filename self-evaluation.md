### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
   - I feel very confident about the content covered. Helping Trey with this assignment and doing my pairing exercise with Noah before completing the CFU on it really helped me breeze through the CFU and cement my understanding with more depth.

### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
   - The more I learn, the more I learn what I don't know. It's dangerous knowledge because as a seeker of knowledge I'm tempted to dive as deep as I can but then I would not finish all the assignments on time. In the context of this lesson, no I do not need any additional learning.

### What questions do you have about Arrays?
   - My main question is why do the [ ] print when console.log an array but not when console.log the output of a method on an array? Is there a way to print a whole array without the brackets?
